# Single-Page cv
This is my single-page cv, based on an exercise from roadmap.sh, frontend roadmap, html: [single-page-cv](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv)

## Tech Stack
This project is a single html page `index.html` and an `images` folder for accesories.

## Running the project
To run the project, you will want to serve the html page.

The easiest way to do this is to drop the html file in your browser, navigate to the file location from your browser, or navigating to the file in finder and selecting "open with..." and selecting your browser.

If you use VScode, I recommend installing the [live server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). You can then simply click "Go Live" and the web page will open up in your browser.
